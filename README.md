# Neural Network from scratch using Python

This project aims to consolidate and apply the concepts covered in the Artificial Intelligence class of LSIA at the University of Guanajuato, specifically in the field of Deep Learning.

Through this work, we seek to provide a deep and practical understanding of neural networks, thus facilitating learning and experimentation with advanced computational models.

You can access the Jupyter Notebook for this project [here](neural_net.ipynb).

## What is a Neural Network in Deep Learning?

A neural network in Deep Learning is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain.

It is composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), where each layer transforms the input data by applying a series of mathematical operations.

Neural networks are capable of learning complex patterns from large volumes of data, making them ideal for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and strategy games.

## Technologies Used

In this project, we will use only Python and the NumPy library to build our neural network from scratch.

Python is a versatile programming language widely used in the field of artificial intelligence, while NumPy provides support for arrays and efficient mathematical operations, essential for the development of Deep Learning models.

## Dataset Used: MNIST

In this project, we will work with the famous MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 images of handwritten digits.

This dataset is widely used in the Deep Learning community to train and test image recognition models.

Each image in MNIST is 28x28 pixels, making it an excellent starting point for those who want to experiment with neural networks and see quick and tangible results.
